Project Overview
Rentalot is a web application that allows users to explore a marketplace of products available for purchase. Users can view all products, post their own products, view detailed product descriptions, and manage their accounts by signing up and logging in. Additionally, users can track how many products they have posted, all while experiencing a beautifully designed interface.

The project is built using Express and Node.js on the backend, with views for rendering dynamic pages, and MongoDB as the database to manage user and product data.
